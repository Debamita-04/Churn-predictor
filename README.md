Customer Churn Prediction System
This project implements a Customer Churn Prediction System using a Random Forest Classifier. It helps businesses identify customers likely to leave (churn) based on their profile and past behavior, enabling proactive retention strategies.

Introduction
Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses that rely on subscription-based services or recurring customers. This system uses customer demographics, account information, and behavior to predict whether a customer is likely to leave.

The tool also provides insights into factors most influencing customer churn, helping businesses refine their strategies.

Features
1.Interactive Menu:
-Predict churn for new customers.
-Check model performance and accuracy.
-View factors influencing churn.

2.Customer Input Simulation:
-Collect details such as credit score, age, location, and more.
-Predict churn with confidence levels.

3.Data Visualization:
-Confusion matrix for prediction performance.
-Bar charts of top factors affecting churn.

4.Model Details:
-Trained using a Random Forest Classifier.
-Scalable to other datasets with similar features.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Pandas: For data preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For model building, training, and evaluation.
